# PyCitySchools Report
After doing some cleaning in the data, there are clear trends that occur in within the data. The first relates to the school spending per student. The range of the total average budget per school went from the lowest $578 to the highest $652. However, examing the dataframe created once broken into four different groups with that rnage reveals that as the student budget increased, their grades decreased. The schools that had a spending range of $645-680 had only 54% of students passing both math and reading. Compared to the schools with a spending range of less than $585 that had about 90% of students passing both. Notably the amounts of students passing math decreased much more than reading did as spendings went up.         
The next thing to note is that the size of the school seemed to have an affect with the amount of students passing. Larger schools appear to have less students passing math and reading compared to medium or small sized schools. The difference being 58% of studetns passing both in larger schools compared to around 90% of students passing for the other two sizes.
